								<h2 class="alt"><a name="inspect_self_cal_p"></a>1. Inspect to choose interval for initial phase self-calibration (steps 4-5)</h2>
								<p class="alt"><a href="#"><font size="-5">&larr; back to top</font></a></p>
								<p>
									In this tutorial, we are going to explore the concept of self-calibration. The premise for self-calibration is simple. Instead of using a compact phase reference source (which we assume to be point-like) i.e., flat in amplitude and zero in phase, we instead assume that the calibrator is resolved. We then derive solutions assuming a model for the true sky brightness. It is called self-calibration as the source we use is often our target source which is used to calibrate itself. See the lectures for all the gory details on how this works. 
								</p>
								<p>
									As you may have guessed, we require a model of the true sky brightness distribution for us to do self-calibration. We have done that already (maybe without you noticing). When we performed our first <code class="language-python">tclean</code> imaging run, we had set <code class="language-python">savemodel='modelcolumn'</code>. This meant that our model image (our 'best guess' of the real sky), was Fourier transformed to create model visibilities (stored in the MODEL column of our measurement set). It is this model that we shall use to compare our visibilities to and correct for residual errors.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let us inspect our model use <code class="language-bash">plotms</code> as we had done in step 1 to plot the model against $uv$ distance.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Take a look at step 4. The parameters have already been set so execute the step. You can try over-plotting the data and model columns on the same GUI window interactively or look at the difference between data and model columns.<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="106"><code class="language-python">	plotms(vis=target+'.ms',
		   xaxis='uvdist',
		   yaxis='amp',
		   ydatacolumn='model',
		   correlation='RR,LL',
		   avgchannel='64',
		   coloraxis='spw',
		   plotfile='',
		   overwrite=True, showgui=gui)</code></pre></li>
		   							</ul>
		   						</p>
		   						<p>
		   							Below we have overplotted these for convenience in python. The top panel shows the visibilities (data column) with the model visibilities overlaid. You can see that our model from imaging is a pretty good approximation to the visibilities. In the bottom panel, the scalar differences are shown illustrating that the model is slightly underestimating the flux density of the source across a large $uv$ distance. These discrepancies are due to the antenna amplitude errors and will be corrected by self-calibration
		   						</p>
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="plots/preself_cal_uv_dist.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>
									Now we have our model present, we will begin by doing phase self-calibration first. As with standard calibration, we need to decide what sort of solution interval we require. However, we have an extra complication as that is the source structure.
									It can be hard to tell the difference between phase errors and source structure in the visibilities, but it helps to balance between choosing a longer interval to optimise S/N, and too long an interval (if possible the phase changes by less than a few tens of degrees). The phase will change most slowly due to source structure on the shortest baseline, Mk2&Pi, but you should also check that the longest baselines (to Cm) to ensure that there is enough S/N. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Take a look at step 5. We want to plot phase against time, averaging all channels per spw (see <code class="language-bash">listobs</code> for the number of channels).<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="144"><code class="language-python">	plotms(vis=target+'.ms',
		   xaxis='**',
		   yaxis='**',
		   antenna='**',
		   correlation='**,**',
		   avgchannel='**',
		   coloraxis='spw',
		   plotfile='',
		   timerange='',
		   overwrite=True, showgui=gui)</code></pre></li>
		   								<li>Once you are happy, execute step 5 and look at the GUI. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The plot below shows a zoom on a few scans. The chosen solution interval should also ideally fit an integral number of times into each scan. It is also a good idea not to use too short a solution interval for the first model. This is because the model may not be very accurate, so you don't want to constrain the solutions too tightly.
							</p>
							<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="plots/3C277.1_phase.png" alt="" /></span></div>
							<p>
								Looking at this plot, we can see that something along a 2-4 min solution interval should be ok to track the phases without too many failed solutions. Keep your solution interval to hand as we want to now derive these corrections.

								<h2 class="alt"><a name="self_cal_derive_p1"></a>2. Derive phase self-calibration solutions (step 6)</h2>
								<p class="alt"><a href="#"><font size="-5">&larr; back to top</font></a></p>
								<p>
									Let's use <code class="language-bash">gaincal</code> to derive solutions.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Take a look at step 6 and enter the parameters in <code class="language-bash">gaincal</code> to conduct phase-only calibration using your selected solution interval,
								<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="163"><code class="language-python">gaincal(vis=target+'.ms',
			calmode='**',          # phase only
			caltable='target.p1',
			field=target,
			solint='**',           # about half a scan duration
			refant=antref,
			minblperant=3, minsnr=5)</code></pre></li>
										<li>We also want to plot these solutions which are done for both polarisations separately using the following code,
										<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="163"><code class="language-python">	plotms(vis='target.p1',
		   gridcols=2, gridrows=3,
		   xaxis='time', yaxis='phase',
		   iteraxis='antenna',
		   coloraxis='spw',
		   plotrange=[-1,-1,-180,180],
		   correlation='L',
		   plotfile='target.p1_L.png', overwrite=True, showgui=gui)

	plotms(vis='target.p1',
		   gridcols=2, gridrows=3,
		   xaxis='time', yaxis='phase',
		   iteraxis='antenna',
		   coloraxis='spw',
		   plotrange=[-1,-1,-180,180],
		   correlation='R',
		   plotfile='target.p1_R.png', overwrite=True, showgui=gui)</code></pre></li>
		   								<li>If you are happy, execute step 6</li>
		   								<li>Check the terminal and logger; there should be no (or almost no) failed solutions.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									You should have solution that look like those below (we used a 180s solution interval). The corrections should be coherent, as they are, and represent the difference caused by the different atmospheric paths between the target and phase-ref, but they may also have a spurious component if the model was imperfect. The target is bright enough that a shorter solution interval could be used. So, these solutions are applied, the data re-imaged and the corrections refined iteratively.

								<h2 class="alt"><a name="self_cal_apply_p1"></a>3. Apply first phase solutions and image again (step 7)</h2>
								<p class="alt"><a href="#"><font size="-5">&larr; back to top</font></a></p>
								<p>
									Let's continue by applying these solutions to the measurement set. Remember that the premise of self-calibration is that we use an iterative approach to gradually improve the calibration of these data. This means we have to get a new improved model (therefore need to correct these data for imaging)
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Take a look at step 7. There's a lot to enter here but most of these you have worked out in previous steps. Firstly, we want to enter the calibration table we just made into <code class="language-bash">applycal</code>,<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="197"><code class="language-python">applycal(vis=target+'.ms',
		 gaintable=['**']) # enter the name of the gaintable</code></pre></li>
		 								<li>Next, we will want to image these data again to generate our new, better model. The weighting and resolution shouldn't change so we want to use the same parameters as we had done previously. Note that the number of iterations has increased as we expect a higher S/N due to phase self-calibration.
		 								<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="202"><code class="language-python">	tclean(vis=target+'.ms',
		   imagename=target+'_p1.clean',
		   cell='**arcsec',
		   niter=3000,
		   cycleniter=300,  
		   deconvolver='clark',
           savemodel='modelcolumn',
		   imsize=['**','**'],
		   interactive=True)</code></pre></li>
		 								<li>Finally, we want to record the rms and peak brightnesses so we can see if there's an improvement. As out imaging parameters are the same, you should try to use the same boxes,
		 								<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="212"><code class="language-python">	rmsp1=imstat(imagename=target+'_p1.clean.image',
				  box='**,**,**,**')['rms'][0]
	peakp1=imstat(imagename=target+'_p1.clean.image',
				  box='**,**,**,**')['max'][0]</code></pre></li>
				  						<li>If you are happy with all of these entries, execute step 7. This may take a minute as the $\texttt{CORRECTED}$ data column needs to be generated.</li>
				  					</ul>
				  				</p>
								<p>
									With these corrections applied we will CLEAN using <code class="language-bash">tclean</code>, as before, but you will be able to do more iterations as the noise should be lower.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once this is complete we will get the peak and rms values. I managed to get $S_p \sim 168 \,\mathrm{mJy\,beam^{-1}}$ and $\sigma \sim 0.282\,\mathrm{mJy\,beam^{-1}}$. This is a massive $\mathrm{S/N}$ increase to $\sim 595$ from $225$ before phase self-calibration.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Important:</b> A key indicator if self-calibration is improving your data is that the S/N should increase each iteration. Do not rely on measuring the rms/peak individually as the self-calibration model could artificially reduce all amplitudes (peak and noise) with no S/N improvement!

								<h2 class="alt"><a name="self_cal_p2"></a>4. Phase-self-calibrate again (step 8)</h2>
								<p class="alt"><a href="#"><font size="-5">&larr; back to top</font></a></p>
								<p>
									Now that the model is better, use a shorter solution interval. Heuristics suggest that 30s is usually about the shortest worth using, because the atmosphere is reasonably stable on these baseline lengths at this frequency.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Take a look at step 8 and enter the parameters for <code class="language-bash">gaincal</code> as before, but now reduce the solution interval to 30s,
								<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="241"><code class="language-python">	gaincal(vis=target+'.ms',
			calmode='**',
			caltable='target.p2',
			field=target,
			solint='**',
			refant=antref,
			gaintable=['**'],
			interp=['**'],
			minblperant=3,minsnr=5)</code></pre></li>
										<li>Have a look at the rest of the step which will produce plots of the calibration table</li>
										<li>When you are happy execute step 8 and take a look at the plots.</li>
									</ul>
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="plots/target.p2_L.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>
									Because we apply the first self-calibration table on the fly, the resultant corrections will be smaller in amplitude that the original corrections. This is a good sign that the self-calibration is working as the phase errors in your data become smaller and smaller. You can see this in the plot below where we have overplotted the first and second calibration table which shows that the standard deviation of the solutions reduces (dotted lines). If you find that the solutions are noisier, then something may be going wrong (e.g., too small of a solution interval was used).

								<h2 class="alt"><a name="apply_im_p"></a>5. Apply the solutions and re-image (step 9)</h2>
								<p class="alt"><a href="#"><font size="-5">&larr; back to top</font></a></p>
								<p>
									Let's apply these solutions and re-image.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Take a look at step 9 and enter the parameters into <code class="language-bash">applycal</code> as before, but making sure we add the new gaintable to the list.<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="279"><code class="language-python">applycal(vis='1252+5634.ms',
			 gaintable=['**', '**'])</code></pre></li>
			 						</ul>
								</p>
								
								<p>
									We also want to image again in this step. From <code class="language-bash">listobs</code>, the total bandwidth is ~10% of the frequency, which is enough for us to need to take the spectral index into account. <a href="plots/aa4338-05.pdf" target="_blank">Cotton et al. (2006)</a> finds the spectral index varies from $-0.1$ in the core to as steep as $-1$.
								</p>
								<p>
									<code class="language-bash">listobs</code> showed the total bandwidth is 4817 to 5329 MHz, i.e. for flux density $S$, $S_{4817}/S_{5329} = (4817/5329)^{-1}$ or about 10%. The improved S/N gives much greater accuracy. Thus, in order to image properly and produce an accurate image to amplitude self-calibrate on all spectral windows, multi-term multi-frequency synthesis (<code class="language-bash">deconvolver='mtmfs'</code>) imaging is used. This solves for the sky model changing across frequency.
								</p>
								<p>	
									<ul>
										<li>Enter the imaging parameters into the <code class="language-bash">tclean</code>	step and the box sizes into the image statistics to track the S/N,<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="284"><code class="language-python">	tclean(vis=target+'.ms',
		   imagename=target+'_p2.clean',
		   cell='**arcsec',
		   niter=4500, # stop before this if residuals reach noise
		   cycleniter=500,
		   gain=0.2,
		   imsize=['**','**'],
		   deconvolver='mtmfs',
		   savemodel='modelcolumn',
		   nterms=2, # Make spectral index image
		   interactive=True)

	rmsp2=imstat(imagename=target+'_p2.clean.image.tt0',
				  box='**,**,**,**')['rms'][0]
	peakp2=imstat(imagename=target+'_p2.clean.image.tt0',
				  box='**,**,**,**')['max'][0]</code></pre></li>
				  						<li>Once you are happy execute step 9 and clean the image! Make sure you clean till as much target flux as possible has been removed into the model - you can increase the number of iterations interactively if you want.</li>
										<li>Use <code class="language-bash">ls</code> to see the names of the image files created. The image name is <code class="language-bash">1252+5634_p2.clean.image.tt0</code>.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									If we check the image using the same boxes as before, I get $S_p \sim 174.779\,\mathrm{mJy\,beam^{-1}}$ and $\sigma \sim 0.155\,\mathrm{mJy\,beam^{-1}}$. This is another large $\mathrm{S/N}$ increase to $\sim 1126$.

								<p class="alt"><a href="#"><font size="-5">&larr; back to top</font></a></p>
								<p>
									Now that we have got the phases in order, we can work on the amplitudes instead. We firstly want to check what an appropriate solution interval will be so we want to use <code class="language-python">plotms</code> to get this information
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>In step 10, use <code class="language-bash">plotms</code> to plot the amplitude versus time of the shortest baseline then execute the step<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="320"><code class="language-python">	plotms(vis=target+'.ms',

		   							You should find a plot similar to that below. The smooth amplitude changes across the duration of the observation are not due to the antennae errors but due to the structure of the source (antennae errors should be on shorter timescales and less smooth). Remember that the projected baseline length changes over time so the sky the baseline 'sees' also changes.

								<p>

									In <code class="language-bash">gaincal</code>, the previous gaintable with short-interval phase solutions will be applied, to allow a longer solution (averaging) interval for amplitude self-calibration. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>

										<li>Once you are happy, execute step 11</li>
									</ul>

								<p>
									This step will also plot the solutions for each polarisation separately (L polarisation is shown below). They should mostly be within about 20% of unity. A few very low/high points implies some bad data. If the solutions are consistently much greater than unity then the model is missing flux.

									We are almost finished and now have corrections for phase and amplitude which we can use to remove all these errors.

									While we have only done three rounds of self-calibration, it is worth noting that you would be expected to do more iterations until the improvements in S/N plateaus and no noticeable improvements are seen in the image. Below, you can see the image improvements at each stage of the self-calibration process and the corresponding improvements in the S/N.

									In the rightmost panel, you can see the result if we continue the self-calibration process (reaching 15 and 30s solution intervals for phase and amplitude, respectively). The majority of these errors have disappeared, the image fidelity has improved significantly and the S/N has peaked at around 3700. If you would like to continue the self-calibration process, the calibration script can be found <a href="./data/3C277.1_imaging_extrasc2024.py" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that not all errors are gone and specialist algorithms and careful flagging of these data is required to improve the S/N further. For the final tutorial on advanced imaging, we shall use this fully self-calibrated data set.
